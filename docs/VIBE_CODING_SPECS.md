# ðŸŒŠ Vibe Coding Specifications for AI Agents

## ðŸŽ¯ Vibe Coding Philosophy

**Vibe Coding** = Specification-driven development that creates code optimized for AI agent collaboration, with maximum clarity, consistency, and extensibility.

### Core Principles
1. **AI-First Documentation**: Every specification written for AI comprehension
2. **Explicit Contracts**: Clear interfaces between components and agents  
3. **Test-Driven Specifications**: Specs include testable acceptance criteria
4. **Evolutionary Architecture**: Designed for continuous enhancement by AI agents
5. **Context-Rich Artifacts**: Maximum context preservation for future AI interactions
