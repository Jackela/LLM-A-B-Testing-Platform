# Manual Integration Tests

This directory contains **manual integration tests** that require specific setup or external services and are run manually rather than as part of the automated CI/CD pipeline.

## üéØ Purpose

Manual integration tests serve to:
- Validate integration with external services that aren't easily mocked
- Test scenarios requiring manual setup or intervention
- Perform exploratory testing of complex workflows
- Validate security and access control mechanisms

# Set up rate limiting rules
# Configure SSL/TLS certificates
```

### Integration Test Environment
```bash
# 1. Database Setup
# Create dedicated test database
# Configure read/write permissions
# Set up connection pooling

# 2. External Services
# Configure LLM provider accounts
# Set up monitoring service connections
# Configure message queue connections

# 3. Infrastructure
# Set up load balancers
# Configure reverse proxies
# Set up SSL termination
```

## üìã Test Execution Checklist

### Pre-Test Setup
